# Darklight Browser
Qt/PySides6 based web browser which uses DuckDuckGo as its default search engine.

# Why not Google?
Google has had controversies with user data collection and tracking, so DuckDuckGo was set with respect to users who value privacy.

## Usage
1. Ensure ```Python3```, ```PySides6```, and ```Qt 5.15.12``` are installed on your system.
2. Run ```git clone https://github.com/Darklight-Browser/DarklightBrowser.git```
3. ```cd``` into the cloned directory and run ```python3 darklight.py```
